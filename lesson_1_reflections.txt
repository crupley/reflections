###How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It placed the two versions side-by-side and each change was easily apparent


###How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes it easy to catch any changes that cause problems later on or to keep
a record of information that could be lost in the future


###What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google docs does?

pro: no over-committing, breaks at sensible points
con: may forget or not commit enough


###Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

git is designed for groups for files working together, Google Docs is meant
for single, unrelated files.


###How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of
files?

git log will show a history of all commits to a repo, the --stat flag will
show more detailed output. git diff will show the changes between two files or
between 2 commits


###How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
that could break something?

Any changes that are made can be tracked and undone ensuring that no permanent
damage can be done.


###Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
###for?

I want to manage my projects and learning progress.
