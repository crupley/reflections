When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository is useful as an off-site backup and as an easy way to
share and collaborate anywhere.
###

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You do not want changes being made while you are working with a repository and
potentially cause confusion.
###

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks copy a repository between github accounts, clones copy a repo locally,
branches are a local version of a fork.
