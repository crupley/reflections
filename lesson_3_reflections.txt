When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository is useful as an off-site backup and as an easy way to
share and collaborate anywhere.
###

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You do not want changes being made while you are working with a repository and
potentially cause confusion.
###

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks copy a repository between github accounts, clones copy a repo locally,
branches are a local version of a fork.
###

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It allows you to work when not connected to the remote, i.e. in the forest.
###

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Changed files could be sent directly via email or they could be kept on some
other shared resource (dropbox, etc.). It would be easier in that it requires
no special knowledge but harder since version changes are not tracked and it
may be difficult keeping track of all the different files.
###

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When the changes are experimental or may conflict with the changes of others.
